This MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) App takes in user input (Burger), stores it in MongoDB, then distributes the information based on whether or not the 'Burger' has been eaten or not. 

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.](https://burger-for-your-computer.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience

After page loads, input the name of your favorite burger and "Make it." Then press "Eat it" to send the burger to the tummy. After that you may press "poop it" to get rid of it altogether. The App has been made in such a way that the what you see on the site is based on particular IP addresses. Every IP address will have a different accounting of bugers made and eaten.
