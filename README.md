This React App takes in users performance on simple mental exercises and gives feedback to the user on how that performance relates to the users self-ratings on "Mood" "Sleep" "Exercise" and "Hunger". 

## Deployment 

This application can be found [here.](https://braingaugefinalproject.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience

After the page loads a you will be able to either create a user (if it is your first time visiting) or login. 
Once you have registered and logged in you will take a survey answering 4 questions meant to gauge your "Mood" "Sleep" "Exercise" and "Hunger". 

After taking the survey you will play the Game which tests your reaction time. 

After playing the game you will be able to see how your Reaction Time as compared with any of your survey answers compare to past results for those survey questions.
